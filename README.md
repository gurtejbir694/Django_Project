# Django_Project

Intro to Project



Ecommerce Bookshop
This project is based on the idea of a bookstore website. It allows the clients visiting the site to signup/login, view books from various categories, read a short summary on the selected book, get to know about the author, its general price on the ecommerce websites such as Amazon. It also allows the clients to see what other books have been written by the author. The website also has a free section, from where the clients can either download or read the pdfs of certain books that are available in the database.
This website is a great visit for those who are looking for their next great read. They can easily read the summary of the book they like and then go and buy the book from a bookstore if they wish too. The website also has a feature to reach out the admin through the contact form for any query they have.
